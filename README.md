All task completed during my ML Internship at Bharat Intern 

ML Internship Repository
Welcome to my ML Internship repository! In this repository, you will find the tasks and projects completed by me during my internship at Bharat Intern. I have worked on various machine learning projects, including a wine quality predictor and a house price predictor. This README file will provide an overview of the repository and the projects included.

* Tasks
1. Wine Quality Predictor
2. House Price Predictor

Wine Quality Predictor
The wine quality predictor is a machine learning model trained to predict the quality of wines based on various chemical properties. The project involved data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, and model training. 

House Price Predictor
The house price predictor is a machine learning model developed to predict the prices of houses based on their features such as area, number of rooms, location, etc. The project included data cleaning, feature selection, model training, and evaluation. 

Install the necessary dependencies. You can refer to the project's documentation for specific instructions.

Run the project's main script or Jupyter notebook to reproduce the results or make predictions using the trained models.
